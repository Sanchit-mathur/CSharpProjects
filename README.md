## Overview
This repository aims to provide practical experience with C# programming and software development practices. The Contact Book application allows users to efficiently manage their contacts, storing essential information like names, departments, and emails. The Calculator application performs basic arithmetic operations, making it easy for users to compute values in a user-friendly manner.

These applications are designed to be straightforward, making them suitable for beginners learning C# while also providing a solid foundation for more advanced features and improvements.

## Technologies Used
- **C#**: The primary programming language used to develop both applications.
- **.NET SDK**: A framework for building and running applications in C#. Ensure you have the latest version installed.
- **Visual Studio or any text editor**: Recommended for writing and executing C# code, but not strictly required.

## Project 1: Contact Book
The Contact Book application is designed to help users organize and manage their contacts effectively.

### Features
- **Add New Contacts**: Users can add contacts with their name, department, and email. This feature allows for quick entry of essential information.
- **Search for Contacts**: Easily find contacts by entering their name, making it simple to retrieve important details without browsing through a long list.
- **Update Existing Contacts**: Modify contact details, such as department and email. This flexibility ensures that users can keep their contact information current.
- **Remove Contacts**: Delete contacts from the list when they are no longer needed, maintaining an organized contact list.
- **List All Contacts**: View a complete list of all added contacts in a formatted display, providing a quick overview of all entries.

### Getting Started
To run the Contact Book application, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com).
   
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CSharpProjects.git
   cd CSharpProjects/ContactBook
   ```

### User Interaction
The application is designed with a simple console interface, allowing users to navigate through options to add, search, update, delete, or list contacts.

### Code Overview
The Contact Book application is structured with a main program file that handles user input and a class that encapsulates contact management functionality.

## Project 2: Calculator
The Calculator application provides a simple and intuitive interface for performing basic arithmetic operations.

### Features
- **Basic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Entry**: Users can reset the current calculation at any time.
- **History of Calculations**: Maintains a history of previous calculations for reference.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Console-based interface that guides users through calculations step-by-step.

### Getting Started
To run the Calculator application, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CSharpProjects.git
   cd CSharpProjects/Calculator
   ```

### User Interaction
The Calculator features a straightforward console interface. Users input numbers and select operations through prompts, making it easy to perform calculations.

### Code Overview
The Calculator application consists of a main program file that interacts with users and a separate class that manages the arithmetic operations and calculation history.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for both applications to enhance usability.
- Add error handling and input validation to ensure robust performance.
- Expand the Calculator to include advanced mathematical functions.
- Integrate data persistence for the Contact Book, allowing contacts to be saved and loaded from a file.
